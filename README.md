# a new determination method for the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses

1. the creation code of the discrete fracture network in 2d by matlab.
2. rotation code of the DFNs
3. transport the DFN model from Matlab to the UDEC ( applying the aperture data)
4. calculate the permeability ellipse ( with a code from internet)
